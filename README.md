# Online Shopping App - Node.js Application

Welcome to the Online Shopping App README! This Node.js application is an online shopping platform that allows users to browse, add, update, delete, and view products. Additionally, users can register and log in using sessions for a personalized experience. They can add products to their cart, place orders, and make payments using credit cards through the Stripe third-party service. Each order is associated with an invoice PDF file and stored for each user. The application uses validation and authentication with Express Validator and supports MongoDB as the database, utilizing Mongoose and EJS to render HTML from the server-side.
